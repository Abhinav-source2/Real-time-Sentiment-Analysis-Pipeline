I watch different news channels other than US media. Us is helping Israel unconditionally and complicit with their genocide has upset the whole Middle East. No more US army in Middle East they say, because US is ruining the democracy in Middle East. AIPAC is hated by Americans, and all the people I talk here in US say they don’t want to vote for Republicans any longer because of the ev*l acts of Trump. Republicans have no moral compass. For decades, a Republican Presidential candidate will not be elected. Trump is filling his pockets and Republicans are loosing future credibility by threatening Gaza and other countries, but people are more mad about the Gaza threat. Its pure ev*l and heartless act of US for Europeans, Middle Easterners…. etc. Trump is on the verge of starting the WW3. There is huge decisions being made among countries! Nobody is waning Trump, Elon and Rubio’s ev*l acts. Where is the US army to warn these loose cannons going crazy everywhere! Israel is a terrorist state for almost the whole world now except for Republicans in US, they say AIPAC is ev*l!",

Exactly 7 years later from the Revelation 12 sign given he signs the Pac of the future behind our back with the UN! Download it! This is demonic! Look at what they say about forcing us all to have a biometric chip that will control you. They can just for misinformation or mal-information seize our properties. Seize our bank accounts. Stop us from buying or selling. Stop us from any transportation which they named every transportation, including public roads. Please go and look up the part which says “transference of global governance”. You come up with President Xi who wrote this part! The UN is now in control of our Government! Yes! Download it and read it! I have only seen two people trying to warn us. But no one is talking about this! Read what the UN can do to Trump and the republicans party! I think America is about to have to go to war. Please look this up and tell and warn people about it! What amazes me it is everything the Bible told us about and it happened.",

The difference is that Trump is not only the boy, but, also the wolf...and the villagers(Americans) are the ones that get destroyed. <br> If you believe anything Trump says you&#39;re an idiot. This man has been lying like a rug about anything that pops in his head since the 1970s. He knows this is his last chance to be president and he&#39;s going to do as much damage to small America as possible over the next four years to make big business and his personal life easier. The way he runs his campaigns using scare tactics and hate to succeed is a true case of mass trickery/hysteria and most of you idiots fell for it. Donald Trump is not like you or me and he doesn&#39;t care about us and you as*holes STILL VOTED FOR HIM!!!!!!!! I don&#39;t get why people are so gullible but im scared because of it. I&#39;ll stay on my hilltop farm ignoring this shyt for the next four years... All you trump supporters can deal with his nonsense. You get what you deserve.<br>Future reference: any time a multiple-felon BILLIONAIRE says he&#39;s more interesting in helping broke people than helping himself he&#39;s lying. Think of how many lies you would have to tell to become that rich. He&#39;s not going to stop now.",

Well my answer is look up Kamala/Biden/Obama nazi salute. <br><br>I&#39;ll wait and see how people defend them but still attack Elon. That would be the definition of hypocrisy.<br><br>My opinion, CNN is not a network of journalists but a hive of political propagandaist. They need to be fack check more often. Its ok to have an opinion but not to lies and twist clear reality to turn innocent gestures into weapons.",

It&#39;s scary how we tend to fetishize and toady to bizarre claims about gender these days. There are left-wing activists who call people who do not accept genders other than male and female intolerant or nefarious, but ironically the &quot;LGBTQ&quot; that they worship so enthusiastically is a  sisyphean idea for humanity that brings no benefits. People are free to call themselves by a gender other than male and female, but it is wrong for the government to support and guarantee that.",

                "comment": "My Friend: I am asking you the most important question of life. Your joy or your sorrow for all eternity \r<br>depends upon your answer. The question is: Are you saved? It is not a question of how good you are, nor if \r<br>you are a church member, but are you saved? Are you sure you will go to Heaven when you die?\r<br>God says in order to go to Heaven, you must be born again. In John 3:7, Jesus said to Nicodemus, “Ye must be \r<br>born again.”\r<br>In the Bible God gives us the plan of how to be born again which means to be saved. His plan is simple! You \r<br>can be saved today. How?\r<br>First, my friend, you must realize you are a sinner. “For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God”\r<br>(Romans 3:23).\r<br>Because you are a sinner, you are condemned to death. “For the wages [payment] of sin is death” (Romans \r<br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNArBr_J8mA&amp;t=383\">6:23</a>). This includes eternal separation from God in Hell.\r<br>“ . . . it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment” (Hebrews 9:27).\r<br>But God loved you so much He gave His only begotten Son, Jesus, to bear your sin and die in your place.\r<br>“ . . . He hath made Him [Jesus, Who knew no sin] to be sin for us . . . that we might be made the righteousness \r<br>of God in Him” (2 Corinthians 5:21).\r<br>Jesus had to shed His blood and die. “For the life of the flesh is in the blood” (Lev. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNArBr_J8mA&amp;t=1031\">17:11</a>). “ . . . without \r<br>shedding of blood is no remission [pardon]” (Hebrews 9:22).\r<br>“ . . . God commendeth His love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.”\r<br>(Romans 5:8).\r<br>Although we cannot understand how, God said my sins and your sins were laid upon Jesus and He died in our \r<br>place. He became our substitute. It is true. God cannot lie.\r<br>My friend, “God . . . commandeth all men everywhere to repent” (Acts 17:30). This repentance is a change of \r<br>mind that agrees with God that one is a sinner, and also agrees with what Jesus did for us on the Cross.\r<br>In Acts 16:30-31, the Philippian jailer asked Paul and Silas: “ . . . ‘Sirs, what must I do to be saved?’ And they \r<br>said, ‘Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved . . . .’ ”\r<br>Simply believe on Him as the one who bore your sin, died in your place, was buried, and whom God \r<br>resurrected. His resurrection powerfully assures that the believer can claim everlasting life when Jesus is \r<br>received as Savior.\r<br>“But as many as received Him, to them gave He power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe \r<br>on His name” (John 1:12).\r<br>“For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.” (Romans 10:13).\r<br>Whosoever includes you. Shall be saved means not maybe, nor can, but shall be saved.\r<br>Surely, you realize you are a sinner. Right now, wherever you are, repenting, lift your heart to God in prayer.\r<br>In Luke 18:13, the sinner prayed: “God be merciful to me a sinner.” Just pray: “Oh God, I know I am a sinner. \r<br>I believe Jesus was my substitute when He died on the Cross. I believe His shed blood, death, burial, and \r<br>resurrection were for me. I now receive Him as my Savior. I thank You for the forgiveness of my sins, the gift \r<br>of salvation and everlasting life, because of Your merciful grace. Amen.”\r<br>Just take God at His word and claim His salvation by faith. Believe, and you will be saved. No church, no \r<br>lodge, no good works can save you. Remember, God does the saving. All of it!\r<br>God’s simple plan of salvation is: You are a sinner. Therefore, unless you believe on Jesus Who died in your \r<br>place, you will spend eternity in Hell. If you believe on Him as your crucified, buried, and risen Savior, you \r<br>receive forgiveness for all of your sins and His gift of eternal salvation by faith.\r<br>You say, “Surely, it cannot be that simple.” Yes, that simple! It is scriptural. It is God’s plan. My friend, believe \r<br>on Jesus and receive Him as Savior today.\r<br>If His plan is not perfectly clear, read this tract over and over, without laying it down, until you understand \r<br>it. Your soul is worth more than all the world.\r<br>“For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul?” (Mark 8:36).\r<br>Be sure you are saved. If you lose your soul, you miss Heaven and lose all. Please! Let God save you this very \r<br>moment.\r<br>God’s power will save you, keep you saved, and enable you to live a victorious Christian life. “There hath no \r<br>temptation taken you but such as is common to man: but God is faithful, Who will not suffer you to be tempted \r<br>above that ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear it” (1 \r<br>Corinthians 10:13).\r<br>Do not trust your feelings. They change. Stand on God’s promises. They never change. After you are saved, \r<br>there are three things to practice daily for spiritual growth:\r<br>Pray -- you talk to God.\r<br>Read your Bible -- God talks to you.\r<br>Witness -- you talk for God.\r<br>You should be baptized in obedience to the Lord Jesus Christ as a public testimony of your salvation, and \r<br>then unite with a Bible-believing church without delay. “Be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of \r<br>our Lord . . . .” (2 Timothy 1:8)\r<br>“Whosoever therefore shall confess [testify of] Me before men, him will I confess also before My Father which \r<br>is in heaven”",

When there is proof, there are no Repercussions. Repercussions need to start being issued strongly. It seems to only happen to those trying to abide by the rules and trying to just get by. However, the people who care, get punished and threatened by the law, and no repercussions of any sort for a large majority of the criminal acts people take. Something needs to start taking place for the dangerous and low-life parents. The devistation of nothing being done when teying to protect and support our children is too much. They need to be shaped up and put in their place. It&#39;s a joke how we can&#39;t protect our children from criminal &quot;co-parents&quot; and the company they keep around our children. Our hands are tied, and good parents get threatened in court or by CPS or the government in some manner, or the blame for the other parents actions gets placed on the parent trying to protect their kids. CPS does nothing when needed, but tears apart good families. They are a JOKE!!! We get taken  advantage of by the government because what we are willing to go through to fight for our children. we care and want to protect them, so we pay the price. Why prosecute a criminal they can&#39;t make money from? So make the people who care pay for what we shouldnt have to, or there is no peace. We get in trouble for with-holding our children to protect them from obvious dangerous situations, all while the criminal parent continues their lifestyle of harm, drugs, fraud, criminal intent, and unfit situations they place children in. children and families continue to suffer unnecessary trauma and treatment due to this. It&#39;s like the liberal government was set up to support and protect and serve criminals and their behavior. When there is plenty of proof, and evidence, its put aside and dismissed. They still walk free with no consequences. It&#39;s obsurd. Something has got to change to protect those who are good parents and good people. Not attack whoever they think they can milk money from because they care. Money that should be going to our children and needs.  Our lives should not be allowed to be dictated by criminal, and criminal co-coparents any longer when they&#39;ve been reported, and have a history of continued crimal behavior. They mock the law and the government and peoples lives. It is our duty as parents, as God commands and says, to protect our children! We have that right and it shouldn&#39;t cost everything or be penalties for doing so! With evidence of course.",

He is absolutely calm. His speech is clear and precise. <br>He is certainly resentful but not vindictive. His project for this new mandate is clear.

Маск не даст соврать - это не в бывшем Твиттер случаино модераторы администрировали с хохотом слова Трампа тогда еще президента США, дописывая ему свои слова и смыслы? а кто мне ответит на вопрос - как так получилось что стрелок в Трампа, не имея прямых контактов ни с какой нанимающей стороной, пошел убивать Трампа на крышу здания? почему ему прострелили ухо? мы все видели и помним это фото! Столтенберг который пытается сеичас втюхать Трампу воину и поделиться с ним &quot;силой&quot; Борреля - не хочет вслух поговорить об этом? или это сегодня в США уже &quot;неприлично&quot;? ;) &quot;- ой! я в домике! - ты человека чуть не убил - ну и что! я в домике! все вопросы к моему личному адвокату!&quot;",

Mr. Trump really should&#39;ve asked for his inauguration ceremony to take place on Tuesday January 21st instead of the 20th out of RESPECT for a civil rights leader who&#39;s B Day IS a national holiday. I&#39;m sure it wouldn&#39;t have ruffled his feathers all that much to wait until the next day 😒. It looked and felt like a forward slap and a backhand to the face of all black people because Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. deserved to have the whole day of January 20th celebrated. We needed the whole day to reflect upon what he did to get us racial equality, voting rights, freedom, RESPECT, fair treatment, honor, and no police brutality or degradation! Dr. King fought tooth and nail and went to jail to get this country&#39;s leaders to be fair and just especially to minority races. His very strong faith in God is the only thing he relied on to get him through those crazy racist unfair times in his life that he didn&#39;t want every other black person to experience. The very least Trump could&#39;ve done was show an inkling of respect and honor to an extremely well known and highly respected civil rights leader and let black people have one day to  reminisce and reflect on Dr. King, what he stood for, what his mission/goal was and to realize his dream came true even though he&#39;s no longer here to tell more about his segregation situations, unacknowledged genuine efforts and an overall blatant disregard for black people in general 🤨😑!",

Honestly, freemasonry should be banned immediately if you want to (do something about the deep state) honestly,that&#39;s obvious,ask JFK what secret societies like Freemasonry leads too?It lead to Hitler thinking he was god,leads to socialism=communism.freemasonry=blueprints for human enslavement.I really don&#39;t think trump is a Freemason,thank the Lord",

Just listen to the way he speaks and his body language: they fit those of a narcissist and bully. His speech is full of hypocrisy. He speaks to the rest of the public like he’s one with them while surrounded himself with all those 1% billionaires who all want a piece of the pie. “America’s decline is over?” Not when you speak of ill of other countries like that. America’s decline will CONTINUE unless you change your attitude and foreign policy of killing, bombing and regime changing. Those immigrants in the southern borders are not the ones causing America’s Decline. It’s easy to blame them.  But the culprits of America’s decline are those very people sitting in the room with him. Obama even said himself: unless you are Native Americans you are illegal aliens or the children of illegal Aliens from some far off alien lands. All I see sitting in there are a bunch of racist white people with yellow hair. No Asians. No blacks. No Latinos. Foreign gangs and criminals? They are the product of AMERICAN CULTURE. El Salvador for example: America dumped American gangs in that country that almost destroyed it until their president took control. “The greatest, most powerful, respected nation in the world, inpspiring the all and admiration of the world?” Not exactly when you keep waging wars, bumbling, killing, and regime changing like the Roman Empire. The above statement sounds more like China, which was inspired by Singapore that also inspired Rwanda. History’s greatest civilization? It’s only been 200 years and already in decline. That’s like 0.04% out of China and India’s 5,000 year civilizations. Why did the Roman Empire fall while China and India lasted 5,000 years? Rome only lasted 500 years. America will follow a similar and even shorter path like 200 years. Any nation that models their empire like Rome will not last long…",

Trump is no peace maker people around the world are in abject fear of what he and his mad policies will bring...what chaos AI? &#39;America First&#39; spoken by Trump means ill fir the rest of the world, not that your Democrats were any good , Trump is turbo charged madness, bullying, Zionism, Climate denial, Planet even inter-Planetary environmental rape.

Trump&#39;s first term, I hated him because this network and others told me to hate him. There was so much propaganda about this man. He&#39;s not perfect but he is the best leader that America needs right now. Congratulations my neighbor&#39;s! We need better leadership here in Canads, and I hope Trump&#39;s leadership next door will force Canada to bring in a leader that will liberate Canadians in all these same ways. The Golden Age is upon us. GOD BLESS us all!",

Don’t let anyone else mislead you on its context or create their own narrative. Many of us hated this man from 2016-2020. Then one day, I watched a whole speech, instead of just relying on a 5 second clip that they put out of context. To my surprise, it was clear that the media lied. Then anytime after that, I watched everything in its entirety that they clipped from him. Then the whole “fake news” made sense. I didn’t have intentions of changing my mind about him. I did it just to seek the truth. After learning the truth, I couldn’t help myself to like him.",

Absolute, unconditional obedience will take the place of civil service. <br>trump proclaims he will act without accountability and unconditionally pursue religious zeal (and undoubtedly of the US&#39;s main partner Israel). <br><br>Foreign xenophobe fear mongering will lead to a further move inwards, protectionism and isolation of America from the rest of the World, exploiting every resource without any concern for its consequences. The people present seem not to realize sanctions and tariffs are not paid by foreign countries but by its own citizens.<br>Its funny how he mentions merit based function fulfillment, when all his cabinet members are appointed based on nepotism and unquestionable obedience.<br><br>More wars ahead apparently and maybe more enemies for America to fight them ? trump proclaims again his unquestionable support for Israel.<br>Gulf of Mexico/America is too funny... He repeats his nonsense about the Panama Canal.. he will abuse his power for that. And the usual Chyna bad hate.<br>Nationalism and nepotistic money pit projects will be more intensely abused to blind the American people into following trumps dictates.<br><br>Not sure what he means with conquering communism.. there was never a real war against communism.. only a McCarthy witch hunt, senseless cold war and debunked domino theory wars in SE Asia. <br>Concluding trump very narrowly speaks in nationalist terms resembling fascist superlatives, appealing to false senses of superioritym zealotry and nationalism.",

Hey Trump, you speak like no one has ever done a proper job in any workfield. Hey Trump, you say America will be respected again, I guess just the opposite thing happens, has anybody ever told you that you can not shovel respect onto people, they will only behave out of fear but not out of respect and trust. I didn&#39;t see any black people in there either, why you talk about Martin Luther? And why do you think American citizens are so ultra exceptional. If you have ever read a book, the most successful people are Indigenous people, they live with the rhythms of nature, all know how to do their crafts, clothes, medicine and other materials themselves and only produce, take and recycle within that economy. I don&#39;t think that you will ever come close to the knowledge of such people, Mr Trump. You may talk big, loud, and blast up your importance like a Kangoroo with fading muscles, but you wouldn&#39;t survive a single day in a forest. I really wish that young men had a better shot on you and you didn&#39;t move your head. But you can be a peacemaker, yes, if you only do that, that&#39;ll be fine, but you always have to win as you repeat so many times - that  is the paradox you&#39;re so full of - I guess you don&#39;t even know what you&#39;re talking about - peacemaking is about not being in competition, but your whole personality is about seeing enemies and being better than anyone else. Sry Donald, no sense in here. No sense.",

He feels now that all the social media we will be filled with lies, half truths, fake news etc etc... in other words when CNN ABC MSNBC CBS were all coordinating their propaganda presentations to the American public that was perfectly okay but now he sees the writing on the wall because there will be another story being told filled with common sense, truth,&amp; transparency. That is why Biden has had to pardon himself his family and many other law-breaking individuals from Fauci to Hunter Biden and all his family members , criminal felons  and all the cover-ups from the highest places in our government. If they were innocent why would they all need to be pardoned ? CNN and all the other mainstream news is now afraid that what they were passing out as truth will now be uncovered as lies  and they will feel the effects of the other side of the story which will reveal to the world the lockstep propaganda machine you ran. All humans are vulnerable to propaganda and in that respect we have compassion for you and pray that one day you will come out from under the lies that have been woven into your beliefs but that you will hold on to those things which were actually true. May all of us find the truth which begins with Jesus Christ and all other truth follows and may God have mercy on all of us so that we can begin to truly love each other from the heart.",

Another thing is trump supporters called Biden a communist to take the heat off  trump, but Trump&#39;s main guy is putton which he&#39;s a communist. But y&#39;all want a president who is friends with the most powerful communist of a country. Wake up history reapets itself Adolf Hitler did the same thing and turned on Russia.

Something like that.. I didn&#39;t and don&#39;t identify with the red or the blue.. but hearing people being against the saying &quot;America First&quot; or calling that racist is just mind blowing.

We pay 500 million in fees, while they pay 39 million. And now they are taking our cars, taking our ships, and even trying to take our planes.\r<br>\r<br>Supporting Trump’s withdrawal is also the best way to save money for the country. We shouldn’t hypocritically participate in a bunch of international organizations; they just want your money. Then they take your money and hold big ceremonies every year, finding media to give you coverage.",

                "comment": "Stick with XRP and BTC as much as you can guys. If everyone sells when it starts to fall, which at one point it will, the dream may be lost because of it being too volatile for companies to get behind. just remember where it&#39;s going and don&#39;t be put off by short term fluctuations and don&#39;t facilitate this dream into becoming a nightmare. The coinbase thing will undoubtedly be replaced by another incident but it will always correct to higher until it&#39;s mooned naturally. Don&#39;t give up on it and start day trading it, it will take too much time and concentration. Remember XRP is probably bitcoin part 2. It is quite unfortunate that the most popular word lately amongst crypto enthusiasts and traders alike is “hodl.” This concept of “holding on for dear life” in itself may not be a bad idea but why hold on to an investment instrument which could make you some money, or make you very miserable tomorrow? Making a good profit off crypto is easy if and only if you can find the right entry point and exit point in your day trading. Someone I discovered that has tremendously helped me with this is Mr. Ivan Patrice. He has a system which is so effective it amazes me. I have been using his signals and strategies and have turned out a very impressive profit over the last two months. I would suggest him for beginners and even more experienced traders who have a problem turning in a consistent profit. His utube  ivanpatrice<br><br><br><br>,..,.,.",

That he will suddenly wipe his hands clean and say: “good job, everyone, we’ve gotten rid of all the bad people, now it’s time to relax,”? Or is it perhaps possible that he will simply generate the next group of scapegoats to blame and to turn the American people against? And are you so certain you will not be apart of that group of scapegoats?",

First let we look trump he met North Korea at border between South Korea &amp; North Korea trump says that time I’m the first USA president I crossed entry to North Korea. After that also he met him again in Singapore but the product or progress just nominal with a positive goal dynamic changes. <br><br>Again he ordered the gulf countries by Leading Saudi Arabia including UAE and Egypt were fought with Qatar between 2017-20 goes off all ties, diplomacy, economic etc. Qatar was isolated by few gulf countries without a legitimate legal process &amp; decision just their decision solely by trump gave order to the Saudi Arabia to blocks everything with Qatar &amp; then at the end his term he sent his as broker mediation to conciliation among those are countries. Even before they had nothing eligible decided just trump desire his legacy name. Cause  Qatar that time during 2017-2020 they’re not any bloc associations or organizations been bans just by trump ambition.<br><br>Third he sent mediator to restore relationship between Eritrea &amp; Ethiopia. In 2018 the 2 countries was started normalization diplomacy but unfortunately trump didn’t pressures to the brutal Isaias regime in Eritrea. So that conducted was not successful due to not impact a right role model. After Ethiopian prime minister awarded Nobel prize, Trump he said this bounty deserves for me instead of gave to the Ethiopian Prime Minster Dr Abi Ali Ahmed. Actually that peace was between the countries it’s been useless &amp; fragile peace. By both parties they didn’t respect as mutual. Because Trump didn’t action to take responsibility &amp; to accomplish at the final stage.<br>Eventually that peace process is destructed due to no follows by US trump team. The mission &amp; journey was crap.",

Most of those people were only charged with trespassing. 4 years for trespassing is ridiculous. Even those who fought with cops, they&#39;ve served enough time to be released. The only people who died that day were Trump supporters. One from a heart attack, i believe one was trampled, and one shot through the door by a trigger happy weakling who shot an unarmed woman who was an air force veteran. Now if a cop shoots an unarmed person any other time the news is all over it. They ignored that one. CNN tries to say a capital police officer died at the capital. But actually he had a stroke at home. That&#39;s sad and I feel for his family. But no capital police died from Trump supporters.",

Shame on the Murdoch family . Money is evil . I will not supporting CNN just like millions of people. What CNN doe isn&#39;t democracy, it is fascists.  Musk gave the hitler salute today, probably no reporting. Booing President Biden and Kamala at inauguration was sick. Trump had very small crowd because he lost the election. Kamala would have filled the outside area, there would be thousands of people. Someone needs to have balls and speak up about the election interference.",

We’ll see. Save my comment and in 4 years you let me know, how things have gone for you. Trump during his first term didn’t manage well the pandemic, gave tax cuts to the wealthy, tripling the national debt. If the debt keeps increasing we’ll be in bad shape.",

                "comment": "&quot;The Golden Age of America begins right now,&quot; because his policies will continue to favor <i>wealthy</i> men in their <i>golden years.</i>  Talking about a crisis of trust, weaponization of government, the radical establishment (contradiction of terms) extracting wealth and power from our citizens, denial of liberty, inflation, the national debt, constitutional rule of law, respect, ending fascism, and being, &quot;...tested and challenged more than any president in our 250-year history,&quot; all reveals he is either the most dishonest man in America, or the least self-aware.  Even after winning a second (last) term, he&#39;s <i>still</i> lying, selling his <i>brand,</i> because if he told the truth, his acolytes would stop buying his merchandise.<br><br>&quot;Make America Great <i>Again,&quot;</i> implies that America&#39;s greatest days lie sometime in the <i>past.</i>  Anyone who believes that, either <i>lacks</i> imagination or <i>relies</i> exclusively on it!<br>America has yet to realize it&#39;s full potential, and policies that inhibit...or even roll back...&quot;Liberty and Justice for <i>all,&quot;</i> can only serve to deter making America <i>greater!</i><br><br>As for Trump&#39;s, &quot;...mandate,&quot; and claim of, &quot;...unification,&quot; behind the Republican Agenda, the majority of voters <i>didn&#39;t</i> vote for him.  He won a <i>plurality</i> of the popular vote, beating Harris by <i>less than 2%</i> of the total vote count, <i>but</i> between Harris, RFK Jr., and other third party or write-in candidates, the collective majority of Americans voted for <i>somebody other than Trump.</i>  He received more votes than any other individual candidate, and he won the Electoral College.  He <i>is</i> the President, but a unified mandate...no!<br><br>Regarding the, &quot;Revolution of Common Sense,&quot; it&#39;s important to remember that any individual&#39;s notion of Common Sense is reflective of their own level of education and life experience.  Common Sense is a phrase people use when they mean, &quot;In accordance with my own preconceptions,&quot; which often rooted in willful, self-serving ignorance!  When Trump said, &quot;I love the poorly educated,&quot; it wasn&#39;t a compliment; it was because poorly educated (or systematically mis-educated) people tend to be more <i>gullible!</i>  On a related note, I would have thought that a man with a Bachelor&#39;s Degree in Economics would understand how tariff&#39;s and deficit spending actually work...or don&#39;t work!<br><br>I will give him credit for one thing.  He&#39;s guaranteed to fulfill <i>some</i> campaign promises!  Ending the federal policies of, &quot;...trying to socially engineer race and gender into every aspect of public and private life,&quot; or subjecting military personnel to, &quot;...radical political theories and social experiments,&quot; will be easy to do.  Just don&#39;t do the thing that already isn&#39;t being done...like targeting <i>innocent</i> political opponents for <i>unjustified</i> prosecution.  Meanwhile, he&#39;ll reinstate military personnel who objected to the COVID vaccine, <i>while</i> again expelling military service personnel for being LGBTQ+ (violating Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, according to the very same Supreme Court <i>he</i> stacked).  Speaking of the military, will our success also be measured by the wars we don&#39;t <i>promote</i> by emboldening foreign leaders who would attack and oppress their neighbors (and own citizens)?<br><br>HOW DARE HE take credit for the release of the hostages in Gaza as though he had anything to do with those months-long negotiations, especially after (as just mentioned) emboldening a regime that continues to systematically oppress an already marginalized demographic group to the point of violent response...only for that same regime then use that violence as an excuse to spend more than a year killing tens of thousands of civilians, more than half of whom were children.<br><br>As for the Gulf of Mexico, Denali, and the Panama Canal, his policies will (1) do absolutely nothing to improve life for Americans and/or (2) violate international law.  As pertains to my second paragraph, returning things to how they used to be...just because they used to be that way...isn&#39;t just a waste of energy; it&#39;s <i>illegal</i> in many cases.  We can&#39;t take back the Panama Canal (or annex Greenland) without committing an act of war.  Changing the names of geographic features won&#39;t affect the price of gas or groceries, but it <i>will</i> require educational institutions to spend money on updated textbooks!  How much will it cost <i>taxpayers</i> to replace History and Geography texts in every public school, and what&#39;s the point if every <i>other</i> nation in the world is not obligated or legally compelled to acknowledge the changes anyway?  Wasted money, wasted energy, wasted air!<br><br>Hearing him utter the phrase, &quot;Manifest Destiny,&quot; literally turned my stomach.  Considering how many millions of people have died because of that philosophy, why does anyone think America needs to, &quot;...increase our territory,&quot; when so many of our <i>current</i> citizens don&#39;t have adequate food, shelter, or medical care.  If you want to make America great, direct your <i>own</i> billions at <i>that</i> problem...and implore your fellow billionaires to do the same...before spending <i>our</i> tax dollars economic imperialism.  What&#39;s the point of, &quot;...growing your business,&quot; if the employees you already have can&#39;t pay their bills?<br><br>Side Note: It&#39;s incredibly revealing to see members of self-described <i>news</i> organizations in the audience...not with cameras, microphones, notepads, or a shred of journalistic integrity, but as sycophantic propagandists whose networks have paid hundreds of millions of dollars in penalties for <i>knowingly</i> perpetuating lies on his behalf!<br><br>I genuinely hope his presidency proves successful <i>for the American people.</i>  Unfortunately history indicates that his primary...if not only...priority is himself.",

                "comment": "“Unfortunately, he&#39;s still wrong about how tariffs work. Any new tariffs imposed by the incoming Trump administration will function the same way as every other tariff: It will drain wealth from American consumers and businesses to enrich the U.S. Treasury. That&#39;s what tax increases do, even when they are proposed by a Republican president and cheered by a crowd of Republican lawmakers, donors, and administration officials.<br><br>Indeed, study after study after study has found that the tariffs Trump levied during his first tenure were paid nearly entirely by American consumers and businesses. The U.S. International Trade Commission concluded in 2023 that American companies and consumers &quot;bore nearly the full cost of these tariffs because import prices increased at the same rate as the tariffs.&quot; That matches what economists warned would happen, and there&#39;s not much room for debate about these facts. In theory and practice, tariffs are paid by Americans.”",

How might the world have unfolded differently if Gore had been where he was rightfully meant to be?<br><br>Don has frightened, bullied, manipulated, bribed, and bought his way back into the very House he turned upside down and inside out during his first term.<br><br>How is that different from what happened in 2000? If it&#39;s not, what might lie ahead for America?<br><br>Those of us who are attuned to reality already know that our system has devolved into a hodgepodge of oligarchy, autocracy, plutocracy, and theocracy, with millionaire and billionaire technocrats—who have major stakes in the game—helping to make the key decisions.<br><br>Am I forgetting anything?<br><br>Oh yes, democratic governance. It&#39;s still limping along for now, but how long will that last if the complete militarization and securitization of government take hold?<br><br>If that happens, what then? Will pesky journalists, dissenters, and members of Congress start showing up poisoned? Accidentally falling from windows? Perhaps the troublesome ones will simply vanish, with no fuss and no mess.<br><br>In his first term, Don boasted that he could shoot people in broad daylight and not lose a single vote. Recently, he subtly incited his mysterious group of willing extremists to shoot through crowds of journalists. You know, those shadowy figures who don&#39;t exist—until they somehow materialize.<br><br>It&#39;s a chilling reality that we&#39;ve become numb to the implications of his rhetoric. As the walls close in, those who once held power in the name of democracy now stand silent, complicit, or too afraid to speak out. The lines between fact and fiction, between right and wrong, are so blurred that it&#39;s hard to discern where the truth lies anymore.<br><br>And so, we find ourselves in a precarious position, questioning not only our present but our future as well. Will we continue down this path, or will the voices of reason and justice rise again before it&#39;s too late? The answer remains uncertain, but one thing is clear: the stakes have never been higher. The future of America, and perhaps the world, hinges on the choices we make in the coming days. Will we reclaim the ideals that once defined us, or will we succumb to the forces that seek to dismantle everything we hold dear? The time to act is now.",

If you want not face the 7 year tribulation here what you must do. 1. Believe Jesus died for all your sins, by shedding his blood for you on the cross, past, present and future. 2. Admit your sinner a you need him. 3. Pray to him on both step 1 and 2, then part you repent on his finished work and blood. you will be SEALED till the day of redemption an can not lose your salvation for no one can gain or earn it, its a free gift. The alternative to not accepting is the 7 year tribulation. Where normal life is gone an be hell on earth. 21 wraiths are place on this earths. Some will be know ones like oceans a rivers turning to red blood and the antichrist kingdom into darkness like pharaohs in exodus. There be new like the scorpion like creature coming out of hell wearing crown to touture all who do not have gods seal (tribulation saints) for five months and you won’t die either. There be two witness who will sent plagues and harm on earth. The dragon, the beast, and false prophet are the satanic trinity. Where they will force you to take the mark of the beast which on right hand or forehead. Do not take this or it will be dam to the lake of fire. But Lucifer will cut your head for refusing to take the mark, all may be martyr. Yes Lucifer the evil one will rule for 7 years and force people rich an poor to worship him attack those who apose his rule even he will trick all to see he is the messiah. Jesus will return at the end of the 7 tribulation with us saints to put Lucifer into the pit and Jesus rule 1000 years. The non believer will be judge a your nam not on book of life, cast to lake of fire. Soon there be new earth, heaven, were god will live with us forever an all evil a suffering is gone. Please accept christ into your heart. God love you so much more then even you own family he want to help you a save you. Give him a chance and trust me you won’t regret it. Soon ww3 after the rapture and Major events will happen but do not fear if you believe Jesus is with you an he got you. i pray you repent an come with us to heaven, for heaven is place beyond are understanding and grander then normal life down here. bless you and thank god for your time in reading this an info here is in the bible mosty in book of revelations and pauls letters. You should also read Isaiah, Ezekiel, Daniel, jonah, Hosea, joel, amos, Nahum, Obadiah and the gosiples matthew, mark, luke and john. god want to you to come to him as your self, speak to him honestly and with love n you see the truth.",

People are in charge of killing, beating, or hurting their animals to occult leadership that Harris was a part of. She didn&#39;t like it that animals could have in life, like, their food, shelter, water, or a sponsor. She hated anything and everything that breathed. We are dirty, infectious, indecent, and inhumane. We are not the, only, ones this way, so is Brook, Shelly, and Fauster, who did whatever Harris wanted them to do. Because, people are that way, something needs to be done, like, animal control, adoption with a background check, and a shelter for animals. No one wants to know the rest of it. The devil didn&#39;t like it that he couldn&#39;t do more harm to them, as if, feeding them to Pakistan and Germany wasn&#39;t enough. They were on our streets torturing dogs, while people tried to sleep at night. We have no protection in San Diego. Last night, I was attacked by three men, a Pasquale, a black one, and one of Hoax&#39;s family members. People don&#39;t want to know what the dispatcher, said, to, me. She said that there is no officer on duty and that no one would be coming out that night. So, I walked around looking for an officer, and in about 20 minutes, I ran into one. He told me that he knew about it and appeared to be frightened of them, until, I told him that one of them had no leg. He had a prosthetic on his right leg, a clear sign, he is a member of John Paul&#39;s occult. We need qualified officers in San Diego, that&#39;s all I know. Watch for witchcraft lettering and words that Satan will expect your enemy to use against you for a fight. Very loyal followers will say whatever he tells them to, and be ready to take action. Satan and the devil can not win inhumanely. A Pasquale is a mixture of Satan and the devil. They are light complected and hate people for no reason at all. They hit, beat, rape, and kill for fun, and love manipulating chemicals on people. They are thieves and swindlers that will attack unexpectedly. New York has them in the Bronx; Chicago in their subways, where women are known to be killed by Harris; and now, Delano California has them.",

Racist Trump wasted time talking about how he is a &quot;victim&quot; when he is a convicted felon, Racist Trump spread false statements of looters robbing the burned down homes in California but never mentioned helping Californians to rebuild their communities Racist Trump will make America a racist nation and the world will not respect us.",

No extra confusing fluff, he went straight into the issues that the left continue to glance over and pretend they don’t exist, he went straight into his solutions for each of these issues he named and named the exact orders he is signing. He already accomplished a ceasefire deal! And my bitcoins are skyrocketing, America smells rich again 😂 so glad it’s not the left who just talk in circles and continue to lie and take our taxes abroad",

Freedom of speech until the “colorblind” rules set in forth serve a specific purpose for a very specific people. Also what a joke “americans can buy the car they want” I want a nice Chinese electric vehicle like the one the owner of ford drives. But I don’t nor ever will have the freedom to do that in America. Because it is not freedom. It is fear, everything this man said is fear mongering disguised as patriotism. History repeats itself, thankfully they are getting rid of the history books so that we don’t have to be aware of the cycle. Ignorance is bliss.

Plus, everything he says that comes out of his mouth now is going to end up being completely untrue when his &quot;presidency&quot; is over. I think Donald Trump enjoys putting on a show and getting attention more than anything else. I like how he never seems to take much in life too seriously except this isn&#39;t the time for jokes! He needs to go back to Hollywood where he belongs because he&#39;s not suited to be the president. He&#39;s a good entertainer but he&#39;s not a good political leader. Your title doesn&#39;t make you a president, your actions do. Someone needs to teach this to Donald Trump!",

Every country in the world is watching in wonderment. We willingly gave our freedom away- walking straight into autocracy!! I fear for our future and the future of our allies. If Trump removes us from NATO- that’ll be the end of Ukraine- and Europe as we know it. It will also endanger our own country. Trump won’t lower the prices of gas or food or anything that matters to the ordinary citizen. He’s has Narcissistic Personality Disorder and has mastered the art of projection!! I still can’t believe that he’s back?! We let this happen. There was 79 million people who didn’t vote in this election- but everyone (except the billionaires bros) will suffer from his stupidity and ignorance!!",

My Dad would have been so proud and touched. The opposition should now see why President Trump over came oppression, misinformation, lies, closeness to death, and received the majority of patriotic support to win the countries votes…God Almighty. Thank you Lord of Lords. The Great I am. Prayers for his safety, his words of truth, his actions to complete his task and worldly love for all. Tears…I can’t thank God enough for our chance to have God back in the worlds homes/families, our country, our states, our communities and our hearts. <br>God has truly “Blessed America “",

Where were the poor, starving masses? Nowhere.<br><br>What kind of world makes the people who were viciously attacked feed and medically care for their attackers? How did Israel and Israelis bear it? Why did President Biden demand this depraved behavior, forcing Israel to provide care and comfort to their enemy?<br><br>Forgive me, but I do not feel joy today. Of course, I am happy three young, innocent women were released. But I am grieving for the Israelis who are still held captive, for the dead Israeli bodies strewn throughout Gaza, and for all those butchered on October 7, 2023. The anguish is exacerbated by the knowledge that the world stood by, and/or looked the other way, and/or celebrated Israel’s problems.<br><br>One of the three women had trouble walking. Clearly, something unspeakable happened to her. During the onset of the criminal assault, Hamas slit the heels of their victims to drastically reduce their ability to flee. Does that explain her disability? Another hostage lost two fingers from being shot during the attack—and the fresh bandages she needed showed that her wounds were never properly treated. For all you college students and other protestors, is this what you emulate: the physical attacks on unarmed citizens?<br><br>This cannot be the end of this story. There has to be revenge: justice demands it. Pave Gaza.",

If he fulfills half of his commitments, the nation will begin a new era that I hope does include changing the U.S. Department of Justice&#39;s policies and helping to restore trust in our system that eroded throughout the years. With Elon Musk in his cabinet, I feel confident that we will reach new milestones along financial lines and the advancement of technology. Though I do not agree with many things in government, I do pray God guides and directs his paths to lead this nation and the world in a more positive direction for the betterment of mankind.",

He needs to repent and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ Acts 2:38 not titles the name singular. If not Mark 16:16 tell him where he&#39;s going. This is the only way to eternal life. You shall know the truth and the truth will set you free. So wake up world, and receive Jesus Christ as our King 👑 amen?",

We are no better when we also speak hate, division. We have to start ignoring negativity and not feeding into it and lowering our standards to it. I didn’t vote for the Biden administration. I didn’t agree with their policies. But I would never wish harm or hate upon them. I actually felt bad for President Biden, and his what appeared to be his failing health and mental health. Instead of mocking and making fun of him, we should have been very concerned and called for help for him.<br><br>The same God that provided provision for president Trump to become president is the same God whose sovereign hand allowed Biden to become president -",

A man who has been accused of sexual assault by 25 women, a man who was best friends with Epstein, a man who was found liable of fucking rape, and a man who committed so many crimes while both in and out of office that he was convicted for. A man who riled up his brainwashed supporters into attacking the Capitol of the United States to try to steal an election that HE LOST. The fact that 77 million people can still vote for this man despite all of this is absolutely disturbing. All because they thought their eggs and bacon costed a little too much. Unbelievable.",

These demonstrations received substantial coverage in major media, as have recent town hall meetings at which constituents have demanded action from their representatives in Congress. This turnout and coverage were undoubtedly gratifying to organizers, but the nascent movement is not yet supported by a media infrastructure adequate to build long-term momentum.\n\n#antitrumpprotest #washingtondc #trumpnews #trump #news18live \n\nn18oc_live\nn18oc_world\n\nNews18 Mobile App - https://onelink.to/desc-youtube",

Additionally, any U.S. citizen should have the opportunity to participate in a similar five-year job cycle within the public sector. If someone holds a permanent job for 40 years, the system itself restricts growth and competition because the government, unlike private companies, never faces bankruptcy. This is why private-sector employees continuously work, learn, and update their skills—otherwise, they risk losing their jobs. Implementing a five-year working cycle would benefit everyone, ensuring adaptability and progress.",

Or allies Europe, who by the way is the biggest human rights violaters In the history of the world south Africa the crusades  regardless why does The United States absolutely have to fund arm and litigate Ukraine and nato&#39;s and the European unions war ? Why can&#39;t they have it themselves? Why is The United States  obligated to be the one who foots the bill . Didn&#39;t anyone listen to Zelensky and what he said about Our oceans that protect us from our enemies and that America needs to feel some of what Ukraine does that&#39;s a threat and an insult trump was standing up for America  and Zelensky is using American weapons not Europe weapons AMERICAN , and when America stops giving the rest of the world who dont like Americans anyway",

If everyone sells when it starts to fall, which at one point it will, the dream may be lost because of it being too volatile for companies to get behind. just remember where it&#39;s going and don&#39;t be put off by short term fluctuations and don&#39;t facilitate this dream into becoming a nightmare. The coinbase thing will undoubtedly be replaced by another incident but it will always correct to higher until it&#39;s mooned naturally. Don&#39;t give up on it and start day trading it, it will take too much time and concentration. Remember XRP is probably bitcoin part 2. It is quite unfortunate that the most popular word lately amongst crypto enthusiasts and traders alike is “hodl.” This concept of “holding on for dear life” in itself may not be a bad idea but why hold on to an investment instrument which could make you some money, or make you very miserable tomorrow? Making a good profit off crypto is easy if and only if you can find the right entry point and exit point in your day trading. Someone I discovered that has tremendously helped me with this is Mr. Ivan Patrice. He has a system which is so effective it amazes me. I have been using his signals and strategies and have turned out a very impressive profit over the last two months. I would suggest him for beginners and even more experienced traders who have a problem turning in a consistent profit. His utube  ivanpatrice<br><br><br> .,.,,,,.,..,",

Don´t be too overconfident as America, despite being the biggest economy and the biggest military is still only 4,23% of worlds population, 6,1% of worlds surface and 26% of GDP. There are huge problems but we hope this will be another pivotal moment in history. The crisis started same time 5 years ago - it woudl be great if that´s the end of it and the start of a new boom. I just fear he believes he´s truly a messanger from god...  he´s not. He´s just another politican but at least an unusual one!",

It could have happen right after the invasion (read - not only - what Naftali Bennett said to Istanbul in march 2022), but the first one who intervened (and who was behind it?!) was Boris Johnson. Who knows something about geo-politics and the last decades? Zelensky promised to end the war, when he becomes president, well, he didn&#39;t and he said, he would kneel before every mother, who lost her child, every woman who lost her husband and every child lost the father, when he doesn&#39;t do the things he promised. And before the shitstorm comes. I have a friend with his family in Ukraine and there are many (not faked) videos about all this and it was all over the news all the time. The people suffer the most, that&#39;s always a tragedy and not only BlackRock is getting richer and richer. Think of what happened in Yugoslavia with the land and the people - it&#39;s a shame...",

The last time he was in power for a while he ran from one scandal to another and made one stupider statement after another. How would it end then? Now he cleverly deceived the people to get into power and start doing what he has planned with Russia. He is not a president and a great leader, because without respect you are nothing. A dictator can lead without the people&#39;s respect. He has always had this really strong narcissist and scoundrel trait and I don&#39;t understand how America elected him as leader even though he doesn&#39;t even represent democracy",

And now, when we in Canada look for British solidarity against a bully threatening economic collapse and annexation of our country, the British government is pandering to him. The British government tried a policy of appeasement in 1939…..we all know how that worked out. Bullies cannot be appeased.",

A United Europe of 27 Countries has 740 Million population, v the USA&#39;s 340 million and Russia&#39;s 140 Million. So, if Europe can get only half of its members to agree, then they are quite a force,...all coming from different points of the compass, having different strengths and capabilities. So, Russia might struggle if things got angry and so far Russia has struggled against little Ukraine, relying on help from Nth Korea and Iran.  That sort of help may not continue for long.",

I don&#39;t want him as my president, so he needs to drop the 51 state talk and treat Canadians as intelligent people rather than as a land to conquer for his &quot;expanding territories.&quot; Same with Greenland and its sovereign people. Stop ignoring the contributions we make and the value we have. I&#39;m not subsidizing the gas station when fueling my car; I&#39;m buying gas. Yes, we need change, but not by being annexed. Work with, not against us, and we both prosper. Or don&#39;t, and we&#39;ll both struggle till we again succeed more independant of one another. Either way, we&#39;ll both survive. Either way, my plans are full steam ahead and will benefit worldwide; not just in my own country. I know struggle and can thrive through it. My country will pick itself up. There are ways to mutually exceed what we could accomplish alone. A people taken by force (economic or brute) will not give you their heart; you&#39;ll have their hatred. A people valued and respected will rise together. No need of ownership. You can&#39;t take someone&#39;s freedom and give them yours. It doesn&#39;t work that way. If freedom is valued, value the sovereignty of all. Not just within your own country. <br><br>The respect erodes every time our rejection of this absurd proposal is ignored.",

In Utah wird behauptet, dass es In der Bibel auch um Inzest, Masturbation, Sodomie, Prostitution, Genitalverstümmelung geht. Grund genug für einen Schulbezirk im US-Bundesstaat Utah, um die Heilige Schrift zu verbieten. Wird die Bibel überarbeitet? Trump hat verboten, dass in den Schulen über Rassismus und Gleichgeschlechtlichkeit diskutiert wird. Trump sieht sich als Messias, der von Gott beauftragt wird, die USA und die Welt zu retten.<br><br>Is President Trump banning the Bible? Did Trump deliberately refuse to lay hands on the Bible? In Utah, it is claimed that the Bible also deals with incest, masturbation, sodomy, prostitution and genital mutilation. Reason enough for a school district in the US state of Utah to ban the Holy Scripture. Is the Bible being revised? Trump has banned discussions about racism and homosexuality in schools. Trump sees himself as the Messiah, commissioned by God to save the USA and the world.",

My family is VERY pro Trump, and I often like to rile them up and play devils advocate to poke holes in some heavy conservative idealoy as I like to keep an open mind and challenge things when everyone in a room feels the same way. I’ve always leaned towards that he was the better candidate and stand by his values, but after listening to this speech Im actually excited for what’s to come. I decided to listen alone to see how I really felt about the speech, and Im truly thoroughly impressed, nothing bad to say about it at all. Damn that was refreshing. 10/10",

Its starts with you first of. Good you wanna make America great /fireee woop woop.. but forcing others to do what they dont want gonna backfire so stick with making America great? and respect a NO, IT IS NOT FOR SALE. We had Greenland 100s years and we already sold West Indies in 1917. We do know you not a fan of danes mhm but you know we make it work and dont come off like you jealous of us it dont suit you .... and put your taxes up lol dosnt do nothing to us WE had one the higest taxes in the world already and we will make it work either way.

Stop stealing the rights of the poeple away and making life all about beauracracy that is set in place to finally loot the quality if life and put us all under a big penalizing thumb. Its evident in his California Round Table in Pacific Palisades. America is behind. Everything is a fine a fee a penalty a road lock a defunction. No investment in infrastructure. All industry gone. No cars made in Detroit. No coal mines no steel production. No mfg plants... No clean healthy pesticide free foods...Just drought blight. No state of the Art transportstion facilities. Cant even take a trsin that wont derail. But we got piwer and energy. Just no water to put out fires. No preparation for mudslides. But great geologists. All retail in California was done for. Homelessness everywhere. Thay just cleaned up all the roadside abandones csmpers. America does need a resurgence and its not more welfare. We beat the 30,&#39;s. Apples and welfare....Corruption has to end! No one living in the midwest anymore. Rerout freshwater to inland not out to the Ocean. Everyone meeds deserves opportunity. How is Kuwait rich and we are poor unless online money cones in. But too much porno type direction. Losing morality. Losing individual charm of multiculturalism and unity by sharing concern for all others. We do need a Golden Age. And deference to those contributions made and honesty about organized blocking with long yerm manipulations to steal lands create mass exoduses and the fixing of Constitutional Place understanding. Its a very uneven sustem Nationwide. Each State is like its own Country. Nationally we need fairness. We need a partnership with Mecico and South America and Canada. We share a Continent. We share a Planet. We share Oceans. We share solar system. We share the Universe. We gotta all Matter <br>Its time my pieple mattered more. These backroom keetings diverting Cali water to the Ocean is crazy. Trump is correct. Things gotta change! Period!",

This speech is the best &amp; most important in modern living memory, certainly the most powerful I can ever remember hearing. How cant anybody not love the guy? He&#39;s a Gentleman. Funny, quite nuts, but stands up to anybody who tries to get in his way. He&#39;s showing our weak, pathetic, awful Government over here in the UK how to be a real patriot, especially for ourselves when our leadership hate us. Its really bad, when they have removed anything to do with Britain&#39;s success from 10 Downing Street. Portraits of, Shakespeare, Elizabeth I and Sir Walter Raleigh  portrait of Margaret Thatcher. Yet Donald Trump has returned Winston Churchill’s bust to the Oval Office, after it was removed by Obama and Biden. Its utterly deplorable &amp; disgusting, that Trump cares more about &amp; is prouder of our history than our own morally bankrupt leadership....",

You are not my president, but you did many things about my nation, even my president not capable of doing that. You yelled about minority genocides in the China, XinJing. You are the supporter of DeFi. Human rights means Donald J. Trump. I personally saw how uou suffered from the media. You are the supporter of freedom of the speech. You want to put Americans in first order, agree. But do not forget about us, who wants to live like humans in the other side. Personally wish you health, family seafty, and seafty of your friends, surroundings. Of course Creature saved you from the bullet, saved you for a reason and I believe that saved for us too.",

If everyone sells when it starts to fall, which at one point it will, the dream may be lost because of it being too volatile for companies to get behind. just remember where it&#39;s going and don&#39;t be put off by short term fluctuations and don&#39;t facilitate this dream into becoming a nightmare. The coinbase thing will undoubtedly be replaced by another incident but it will always correct to higher until it&#39;s mooned naturally. Don&#39;t give up on it and start day trading it, it will take too much time and concentration. Remember XRP is probably bitcoin part 2. It is quite unfortunate that the most popular word lately amongst crypto enthusiasts and traders alike is “hodl.” This concept of “holding on for dear life” in itself may not be a bad idea but why hold on to an investment instrument which could make you some money, or make you very miserable tomorrow? Making a good profit off crypto is easy if and only if you can find the right entry point and exit point in your day trading. Someone I discovered that has tremendously helped me with this is Mr. Ivan Patrice. He has a system which is so effective it amazes me. I have been using his signals and strategies and have turned out a very impressive profit over the last two months. I would suggest him for beginners and even more experienced traders who have a problem turning in a consistent profit. His utube  ivanpatrice<br><br><br>,.,.,..,,.,.",

                "comment": "The concept of a Russian world order and the implications of a BRICS currency on a global scale are complex and multifaceted topics. The BRICS nations, comprising Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa, have been seeking to establish a more multipolar world order, with a greater emphasis on cooperation and mutual benefit among emerging economies 1.\r<br>\r<br>One of the key objectives of the BRICS bloc is to reduce its reliance on the US dollar and promote the use of local currencies in international trade 2. This has led to discussions about the possibility of establishing a BRICS currency, which could potentially challenge the dominance of the US dollar in global trade 3.\r<br>\r<br>However, the creation of a BRICS currency would require significant political and economic compromises among the member states, including the establishment of a banking union, a fiscal union, and macroeconomic convergence 2. Despite these challenges, a united BRICS currency could boost trade and global influence among the member states, while also reducing their reliance on the US dollar 3.\r<br>\r<br>The BRICS economies already account for a significant share of global gross domestic product, with an estimated 37.3% based on purchasing power parity 4. China alone is a major driver of global economic growth, and its economic influence is likely to continue to grow in the coming years 4.\r<br>\r<br>A stronger BRICS+ could have a significant global impact in various areas, including energy, trade networks, infrastructure, monetary policy, and technology 5. The establishment of a BRICS currency could also contribute to a more diversified and stable global financial system, reducing the risks associated with a single dominant currency 6.\r<br>\r<br>However, the use of local currencies in international trade is still limited, and the US dollar remains the dominant currency in global commodity trade 8. To overcome this challenge, the BRICS nations would need to develop a more robust and integrated financial system, with a strong and stable currency that can compete with the US dollar 9.\r<br>\r<br>In the aftermath of the 2009 Yekaterinburg summit, the BRIC nations announced the need for a new global reserve currency, which would have to be &quot;diverse, stable, and predictable&quot; 10. While the idea of a BRICS currency is still in its infancy, it has the potential to contribute to a more multipolar world order, with a greater emphasis on cooperation and mutual benefit among emerging economies 1.\r<br>\r<br>Information is missing on the specific details of the proposed BRICS currency, including its design, implementation, and potential impact on global trade and finance. Further research and analysis are needed to fully understand the implications of a BRICS currency on a global scale.\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>Since the 2nd world war comes to an end of capitalization perhaps books that explore the concept of a post-capitalist society. Here are a few notable ones:\r<br>\r<br>&quot;Das Kapital&quot; by Karl Marx: While not directly about the end of capitalization, this book is a foundational critique of capitalism and explores the idea of a socialist or communist alternative.\r<br>\r<br>&quot;The End of History and the Last Man&quot; by Francis Fukuyama: This book doesn&#39;t specifically argue for the end of capitalization but explores the idea that liberal democracy and free-market capitalism might be the final form of human government, marking the end of history as we know it.\r<br>\r<br>&quot;PostCapitalism: A Guide to Our Future&quot; by Paul Mason: Mason argues that the current form of capitalism is coming to an end due to technological advancements and offers a vision of a post-capitalist future.\r<br>\r<br>&quot;The Zero Marginal Cost Society&quot; by Jeremy Rifkin: Rifkin explores how the Internet of things and other technological changes could lead to a nearly free economy, potentially undermining traditional capitalist structures.\r<br>\r<br>&quot;Utopia for Realists: And How We Can Get There&quot; by Rutger Bregman: While not exclusively focused on the end of capitalization, Bregman discusses various utopian ideas, including a universal basic income, which could significantly alter how we think about work and wealth.\r<br>\r<br>&quot;Doughnut Economics: Seven Ways to Think Like a 21st-Century Economist&quot; by Kate Raworth: Raworth challenges traditional economic thinking, including aspects of capitalism, and proposes a new model that prioritizes human well-being and environmental sustainability.\r<br>\r<br>These books offer a range of perspectives on the future of capitalism and potential alternatives. They&#39;re a good starting point for anyone interested in exploring these ideas further.",

In my opinion because of the way the United States has been for so long. There are too many lazy generational people walking around and I don’t think it’ll ever get to that point again. I think that the one thing that the administration he defeated is laughing at is the fact that they ruined the motivation of the people that he wants to motivate.. in my opinion it’s not gonna happen because of it",

Thank you to Donald Trump for winning. I hope everybody goes to church and learns of Jesus Christ, Father God and the Holy Spirit. I hope the internet can be used to be a launch point to help point the American People to Jesus Christ. Also, for United States Economic Building. The minds of the American People need to be renewed according to the Faith of Christ. Love Jesus Christ, love Blessed Mary, Jesus Christ&#39;s mother, love Holy Father God, Love all of the Holy Angels, Love, Love all people, Love the living saints, love the resurrected Saints, love all sleeping saints. Seek first the righteousness and Kingdom of God. Be Good. Love your neighbor.",

He co ti yea to lie and cheat and lie and cheat but everybody is so hypnotized by all of the “promises” he continues to make but cannot keep. He continues to create problems and go back and fix them and he is the hero again.

The main intention would be to bring opportunities and prosperity for Americans and make US a  safer place and reduce cost of living. In terms of foreign policy surely he will stop the Ukraine war and maybe leaves NATO altogether. His aim would be to create a better life for Americans by  moving manufacturing facilities back to America, increase import tariffs and increase oil and gas production for export (this will create massive number of job opportunities). and most important, Christian culture will be back which will result in strong family ties and also, only male and female.  Everything he said is possible and achievable. Of course, strong military and defence (only for world peace). Great President. Excellent speech.",

Hes saying America wasnt great, that you weren&#39;t free and that you werent the dominant country.  <br>  Unless Trump has a plan to start making every single item he threatens to tariff you&#39;ll just be paying more for the same thing.  Whats even crazier is that American businesses importing the goods are the ones paying these tariffs. It only hurts other countries if the tariffs make their product unaffordable for American businesses.  Generally, if you&#39;re already importing it, its becsuse its the cheapest way to obtsin it.  If you add a 25% tariff to $1 the american people will pay $1.25, unless tbey can find a different place to buy it for $1 or make it for less (you can&#39;t even come close), your paying tbe $1.25 from now on. Perhaps a bit basic but it fets the point accross. <br>  Trump will not gain the respect he thinks you&#39;re lacking in the world. He just said he&#39;s going to invade Panama and seize control of their biggest asset. They are your ally and a sovereign nation.  If nothing else, this will haunt your country for generations.  Trump talks of peace but every word is a threat. The entire speech was aimed at real or his perceived enemies, including your fellow country man and threats towards your allies.  He spoke like a dictator. He&#39;s going to use his power for his and whatever his end goal is eith Elon Musk.  I guarantee you and I have no idea what it really is.  What a disgrace",

Thats more power than your president and its intentional.  You&#39;re cheering a man that will sell your country for profit and has no loyalty except to himself. Dictator Musk no longer sounds as ridiculous and impossible as it did.  How does a constitution like yours give a civilian that can buy anyone or anything that much power?  The information your giving him is worth his total net worth ten times over and he&#39;ll use it to make himself unstoppable.  Your making Elon the most valuble commodity on the planet and doing it with a smile. <br>  This speech will be taught in schools for generations. Democracy in your country is declining, today you signed it into its death throws. Good luck America. I hope the ideals your country was founded on survives this. <br> Trump says he&#39;ll eliminate America&#39;s enemies but we all know its all about him, not you.",

Here are the key points regarding China&#39;s connection to the Panama Canal:<br><br>    Commercial Ties:<br>        Chinese companies are among the largest users of the Panama Canal. The canal is critical for China&#39;s trade with the Americas, as it provides a faster route for shipping goods between Asia and the east coasts of North and South America.<br>        A considerable portion of the cargo passing through the canal is either destined for or originates from China.<br><br>    Port Operations:<br>        Chinese companies have investments in port facilities near the Panama Canal. For example, China’s Hutchison Ports operates ports on both ends of the canal: in Balboa on the Pacific side and in Colón on the Atlantic side. These ports play a critical role in transshipment and logistics.<br><br>    Panama-China Relations:<br>        In 2017, Panama severed diplomatic ties with Taiwan and established formal relations with China. Since then, China has become a significant economic partner for Panama, engaging in trade, infrastructure projects, and investments.<br><br>    Infrastructure Projects:<br>        Chinese companies have shown interest in infrastructure projects in Panama, including proposals to build or modernize railways, highways, and ports. Some of these projects have been linked to China&#39;s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), which aims to expand China&#39;s global trade and influence.<br><br>No Direct Control of the Canal<br><br>Despite these ties, the Panama Canal Authority (ACP) retains full control over the canal&#39;s operation. China&#39;s influence is primarily economic and strategic, rather than administrative or operational.",

Just wish Donald had put a little less emphasis on financial success and emphasized the moral and spiritual things more.  Like the fact that since abortion has been legalized in America since the 1970s, we have slaughtered OVER 60 MILLION UNBORN BABIES in this country.  Also there are very, very serious, and ongoing human trafficing and drug trafficing problems in this country.  Anyway, maybe he will have several people fully focused on these extremely important evils.  All Glory to God....",

                "comment": "TRUMP MAY HAVE A MORE DIFFICULT TIME THAN MANY THINK<br><br>I consider myself a Trumper. I very much want him to be successful. But, I think he faces more problems than most people think. <br><br>Listed below are factors that will make it difficult for Trump to secede as President. As most things in life, the concept of “follow the money” applies to almost all of these things. <br><br>Mainstream Media….. The mainstream media is the source of info for most Americans.  However they have devolved into a propaganda agency for the democrats who lie to the American people. I do not think it too strong to say that anyone working for the mainstream media is working against the United States and it’s President. This will not change from the past years.<br><br>Irrational hate ….. Many Americans have no problem with child sex trafficking or 100,000 deaths due to drugs. They have no problem with a proxy war with Russia that could end the world ……….Yet, they have a big problem with the color of Trump’s hair or tie. They think it&#39;s a big problem because he called somebody a name. This irrational hate will remain.<br><br>Haters are already hidden in the system ….. Government workers fall into 2 groups. Those who agree with the left. And, the rest who remain silent because they are scared of losing their jobs if they say something. Neither group is going away.<br><br>Race ….. Race has entered into all aspects of our society. The education problem is in reality a race problem. The crime problem is largely a race problem. The legal problems are largely a race problem. This issue may be unsolvable.<br><br>Democrats ….. Democrats (both politicians and the voters who support them) twice impeached Trump for political reasons. They are responsible for the border crisis, the drug crisis, child sex trafficking, inflation, the proxy war in Ukraine………They will still be there to impede Trump.<br><br>Never Trumpers….. Trump is not one of them. He is not beholding to them. They are scared of Trump coming after their power and money. Like democrats and the media, they will continue to be there to impede his plans. <br><br>Education ….. K thru university is a mess. However, the problem is really a reaction to trying to accommodate  Black people&#39;s lack of ability in education. In an effort to mollify the Black population, we have severely damaged the education of our nation’s youth.  To compound the difficulty of any solution, education is not even a federal issue.<br><br>Hollywood….. Like the media, the entertainment industry reaches the American people every day with negativity. And like the media, some agree with the left and the rest are too scared of losing their jobs to say anything in support of Trump. <br><br>Corrupt government agencies ….. FBI, CIA, DOJ, DOS, and the intel agencies remain to impede Trump.<br><br>Woke issues ….. Woke issues have infiltrated almost all aspects of our culture, and many people are making a lot of money on this issue. Also, most of these folks are democrats.<br><br>Military Industrial Complex (MIC) ….. We have been at war  almost constantly since the end of WW2 (loosing them all).  The MIC has made many billions. This much money and this many jobs will cause many politicians to protect them at Trump’s expense.<br><br>Abortion….. For many women, this is the ONLY issue. It is more important to them than war, education, jobs, inflation, and medical care. This issue will not go away. Whoever supports the killing of babies will win their support.<br><br>Local politicians ….. They are the source of shoplifting, home invasions, legal attacks such as going after Trump, and sanctuary cities and states. Until these local politicians are voted out of office this will continue to haunt America.<br><br><br>Then, there are the contemporary issues he needs to address.<br><br>China, Russia, N Korea, Middle east<br>The debt<br>The dollar<br>Climate<br>Medical care<br>Ukraine<br>75 years of almost continuous warfare (all losses)<br>Our military<br>Immigration and border<br>Jobs<br>AI Computers<br>UFO’s<br>Illegal aliens<br><br><br>Lastly<br><br>Trump is an old man who only has 4 years to get things done",

You should not interrupt him, let him talk, he talks as if he is in an election campaign, the ghosts of Obama, Hillary and Kamala still haunt him, he has a complex, even after he became president, he still goes on with election campaign talks, does he not believe that he won, it seems that he is in dire need of a psychological counselor... He talks about Zelensky being a dictator, can he tell Putin that or play with him as he played with Zelensky? The answer is of course not, he is afraid of World War III happening and he does not know that the war has already started. All that remains is the entanglement of the spots, as the wars have been raging for years!!! Trump, with his ring diplomacy and ridiculous wrestling plots, wants to provoke a quarrel with Ukraine to abandon its support during his term and make a deal with his secret electoral ally!!!!!<br>Trump stops support programs during the Biden era, which include health, social and cultural programs for the Third World and others. He has gone from stealing oil in exchange for destruction to the advance payment strategy,,<br>When a broker rules a diaspora country,,,<br>Artificial intelligence question:<br>Why does Trump behave like this? Does he not know the etiquette of hospitality and negotiation protocols, or does he have a longing for the ring and wrestling?<br>Answer:<br>(I cannot help with responses related to elections and political figures at the moment. Although I never intend to share anything inaccurate. However, some errors may occur. So, while I work on improving my capabilities, you can try a Google search.)&#39;)<br>Your capabilities are broken and humbled only by Trump, and other than him, a waterfall of non-stop conversations. I am amazed at you!!!",

Really, this whole thing is over about 20% of Ukraine. Eastern Ukraine is like 95% ethnic Russian. They voted to leave Ukraine and Ukraine said no. And they’ve basically been at war with eastern Ukraine which is basically a russia proxy. Plus, NATO, Europe, and the US have violated multiple peace agreements. Not saying russia has held up their end on every single deal either, but Europe and the US were indeed the primary hostile actor. Putin is not trying to conquer Europe, I bet he’ll settle for East Ukraine and yet another assurance to not join nato, and hey, the war is done. Seems like there’s another group involved here that wants to see this continue .",

I think this is what Zelensky was hinting at. The situation is pitiful. I was so relieved when Trump got in but no longer have the same hopes. Perhaps Zelensky should sign a rare metals deal with China. That would be a safer solution than pretending the US is in a position to provide security. It would also sideline the threat of EU and NATO defence proximity to Russia borders.",

However, viewing the TV interaction I believe that JD Vance &amp; President Trump bullied Zelensky and tried to shut Zelensky down instead of really listening to what Zelensky was asking for which was reassurance that the US was 100% supportive of Ukraine and not stand silently by should Putin break the agreement yet again. <br>To date I have admired and supported Trump and Vance and the Republican Party but on this exchange  I believe they have erred!  I will concede that as a TV spectator  I naturally am not privy to any background talks that would have taken place before the meeting in the oval office.",

It is the American version of the Chinese Belt and Road Initiative. It is sad to see how dumb Zelensky was for his inability to see what is behind the mineral deals truly are.",

I trust the North American people and they are not happy with Trump&#39;s stance. Trump uses the speech that he is protected by an ocean, but he forgets that the years have changed, as have the weapons. Europeans were slow to respond to Germany&#39;s attacks during World War I, as they believed that German pan-Germanism would not spread. We all know the result of this. Responding to Putin&#39;s attacks does not mean giving money to Ukraine, but making sure we do not experience a Third World War. Putin needs to understand and respect the independence that nations have. Therefore, if necessary, Putin must be broken so that the message can be transmitted. Putin&#39;s expansionism will not stop in Ukraine, as he wants to revive the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. Therefore, the means must be guaranteed for Ukraine to overthrow Putin. No matter what economic crisis will befall Russia, Putin must fall. Freedom to Ukraine, I voted on death!",
